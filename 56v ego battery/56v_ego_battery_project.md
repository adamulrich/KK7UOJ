# 56v EGO Power Battery Adapter

After watching the summary of using power tool batteries as your power supply for your radio, I decided to try my hand with the batteries I have around the house.

I have 2 5ah li-ion batteries that work with my EGO power tools.

I happen to have 4 chargers to go along with these batteries. Rather than buy an adapter, I decided to remove the charger components and place my 12v transformer inside.

I got the charger open and removed the charging board, the fan and indicator lights.

I stripped the wires on the positive and negative terminals, then I connected them using solder shrink tubes to the correct wires on the 12v transformer. Then I mounted the transformer inside the _former_ charger, and ran the 12v output wires out the indicator light holes, and sealed it up.

After closing the box back up, I ran a test on my radio. Note that my radio has a 13.8 +/- 15% operating voltage, which means that 12v is in the range.
