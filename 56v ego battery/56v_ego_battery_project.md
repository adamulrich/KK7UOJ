# 56v EGO Power Battery Adapter

After watching a summary of using power tool batteries as your power supply for your radio, I decided to try my hand with the batteries I have around the house.

I have 2 56v 5ah li-ion batteries that work with my EGO power tools. Note that 5Ah @56v = 23Ah @ 12v. My radio draws 0.2A standby, 0.3A rx, 4.0 tx. 

Using a 90 sb / 5 rx - 5 tx duty cycle, I calculate that 1 battery will last 58 hours.

I happen to have 4 chargers to go along with these batteries. Rather than buy an adapter, I decided to remove the charger components and place my 12v transformer inside.

I got the charger open and removed the charging board, the fan and indicator lights.

I stripped the wires on the positive and negative terminals, then I connected them to the correct wires on the 12v transformer. 

I used a 20-90v to 12v 20A transformer.

Then I mounted the transformer inside the _former_ charger case, and ran the 12v output wires out the hole for the power cord, and attached a T Type connector to the end.

After closing the box back up, I ran a test on my radio. Note that my radio has a 13.8 +/- 15% operating voltage, which means that 12v is in the range.
